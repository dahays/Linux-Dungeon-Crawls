# Linux Dungeon Crawl

Linux Dungeon Crawl is a collection of hands-on, story-driven Linux command-line activities.  
Each “dungeon” is a self-contained lab where students explore, solve puzzles, and practice real Linux skills.

The goal is to teach Linux fundamentals, process management, file system navigation, and basic security concepts in a fun, progressive way.

## Installing a Dungeon Crawl

Each dungeon comes with a setup script. To install a dungeon:

1. Open a terminal in your Linux environment (local VM or CYBER.ORG range)
2. Download the setup script using `wget`:

```bash
wget -O setup_hydra.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dahays/Linux-Dungeon-Crawls/main/setup_hydra.sh
wget -O setup_ghost.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dahays/Linux-Dungeon-Crawls/main/setup_ghost.sh
